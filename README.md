    - Decision Tree Classifier with libraries

### 3. Performance Analysis

    - Accuracy: proportion of correctly predicted labels
    - Confusion Matrix: TP, FP etc.
    - Precision, Recall, F1 Score - performance in imbalanced dataset
    - ROC-AUC Curve

## Objective: Mastering Decision Tree Regressor

### 1. Theoretical Mastery
